# Program Description

As part of the project, an application has been created for organizing books that you want to read or have already read. The application is divided into two parts - book information and ratings. In the second part, users can add their ratings for the books and leave comments.

# User Manual

Upon launching the application, no application window appears. On the left side of the screen, there is a search field where you can search for book titles. After searching, the book's details, including the author, publisher, description, and the option to mark whether the book has been read or is on your wishlist, are displayed.

On the top right corner, there is a "My Library" button. Upon selecting "My Library," a new window opens. In this window, there are two tables: the first displays books that have been read, and the second displays books you plan to read. Under "My Library," the book's rating is displayed, and by clicking a button, another window with user comments about the selected book opens. In this window, users can add their own opinions and comments about the book.
